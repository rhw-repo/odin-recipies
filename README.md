This project uses a basic HTML boilerplate and creates a simple recipe website with a main index page and a few links to recipies. An empty repo was created on Github and cloned into VS Code running on Xubuntu in a virtual machine (so we're in a Linux environment). It includes simple HMTL lists, links and images. The finished procudt was staged, committed and pushed to Github.
